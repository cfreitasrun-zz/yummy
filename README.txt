 Click the twitter icon. [Watch me code this in under 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo0aVl-CiWc) (you can also speed it up if you feel I'm typing/ speaking too slow). Works fully in WebKit browsers and in Firefox (with the `layout.css.clip-path-shapes.enabled` flag set to `true` in `about:config`). If you like this demo in particular and my demos in general, please consider one of the following:

* getting me something from [my Amazon WishList](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2Y3C4722GXH0I/)

* or this [t-shirt](http://merchdome.com/ACCEPT-Girlieshirt-Restless-and-Wild-Since-1982_1)  (size S) that I couldn't find on Amazon, but I absolutely love

* or at least supporting the [Edge implementation of the immensely useful `clip-path`](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6519995-support-clip-path-property) - your votes can make a difference!

* oh, also, why not share this to show the rest of the world what can be done on the web these days?

Thank you!
